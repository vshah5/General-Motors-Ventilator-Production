# General-Motors-Ventilator-Production
The purpose of this report is to provide a framework for crafting a distribution strategy for GM’s Ventilator Project for U.S states. For this, two optimization models were used, one which maximized the number of ventilators distributed and the second model which minimized the cost of distribution.

To meet the goals of GM’s management, namely craft a distribution strategy and minimize costs, two models have been built. The first optimizes the proportion of ventilator demand per state, while the second minimizes the total cost of transportation. The model also allows GM to set a generic price with a 5% mark up to cover any unforeseen expenses.
